My name is João Pedro Gonçalves, I was born on 07/07/2006.
I'm interested in technology, basketball and how humanity can change and evolve.
I like studying, listening to music (soundtracks) especially from games, I'm a big fan of Jonh Powell's works (my favorite is Test Drive, about how to train your dragon).
I'm not a person who talks a lot, I prefer to listen and then suggest how to conclude the idea.
I may not understand something, but if that happens I look for the answer and try to apply it to the doubt and problem.
